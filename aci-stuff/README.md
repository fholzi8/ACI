# Jose's stuff
To share different projects I am working on

ACIHealth.wdgt moved to its own repository (https://github.com/erjosito/ACIHealth.wdgt)

VBA-Cable_Plan.xlsm moved to its own repository (https://github.com/erjosito/VBA-ACI)

cpu_monitor.py: this is a Python script that autoscales up and down a Web farm, adding the new VMs to the F5 BigIP server pool using ACI's API

json2doc.py: converts ACI tenant config in JSON (can be generated with the Save As function in the GUI) in a Word document including diagrams. You can see an output example in the file pod1.docx

You can find the UCSD stuff in Cisco communities here (since GitHub is apparently not the ideal tool to share UCSD workflows):
- REST API custom tasks: https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-58159
- Openstack custom tasks: https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-58158
